# TilemapGenerator

#The script that sums up the whole project can be found here...


#TilemapGenerator/Assets/Spawner/TextReadTilemapGenerator.cs 


#Make sure your tile dimensions are in sync with world unit dimensions!


#ie


#The example in this project has tiles with dimensions 2048px by 2048px


#The world unit size is 512px so the step size for the tilemap script
is set to 4


#The spawner moves 4 units at a time so tiles spawn in a seamless manner.


#The script is set up to read alphanumeric characters. (0-9 and a-z)
